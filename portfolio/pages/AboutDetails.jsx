                        <p>
                            I‚Äôm a passionate and self-motivated web developer with a deep interest in technology and creating things from scratch.
                            My curiosity for tech began back in school when I watched movies about hacking and cybersecurity ‚Äî it sparked a dream
                            to one day work in that world. That initial fascination grew into a desire to build and explore, especially in game
                            development, which pushed me deeper into the tech world during college.

                        <p>
                            I started my coding journey by learning HTML and CSS on my own, creating simple layouts in the early stages.
                            This was followed by learning programming languages like C++ and Python to strengthen my fundamentals.
                            Later, I transitioned into web development by mastering JavaScript and its popular frameworks ‚Äî React for frontend,
                            Node.js and Express for backend, and MongoDB for databases ‚Äî shaping me into a full-stack web developer.

                        <p>
                            During my learning, I developed mini projects such as a weather app, a todo list application, and my personal portfolio website.
                            These projects not only improved my technical knowledge but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities, team workflow understanding,
                            and application structure.

                        <p>
                            Mathematics has always been my favorite subject. It gives me satisfaction when I solve problems and reach accurate solutions ‚Äî
                            a mindset that deeply helps in programming and debugging. This logical thinking greatly benefits my ability to solve coding challenges

                        <p>
                            I love building things from scratch, similar to how I enjoy planning strategies in my favorite game, Clash of Clans.
                            It helps me develop soft skills like time management, resource planning, and patience ‚Äî all of which I carry into my coding approach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe in writing code that is not just functional, but also clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
                            My focus is always on performance, accessibility, and user experience.

                        Outside of development, I enjoy drawing to relax, watching movies (especially from the Marvel Cinematic Universe),
                        and cooking ‚Äî a hobby that brings me joy and creativity. I‚Äôve even worked part-time in restaurants, which helped me
                        develop real-world communication and teamwork skills.
